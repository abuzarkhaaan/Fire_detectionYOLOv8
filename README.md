# Fire Detection Model Using YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Fire Detection** model using **YOLOv8**, optimized for detecting fire in various environments. The model can process real-time video feeds or images to provide timely fire alerts.

### Key Features:
- **YOLOv8 Architecture**: Leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 architecture for fast and accurate fire detection.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for quick processing, allowing the detection of fire as it occurs.
- **Custom Trained Weights**: Pre-trained on a comprehensive fire dataset and stored in a zip file. The model is fine-tuned for detecting fire across various conditions and angles.
- **Classes**: The model is designed to detect a single class - fire.
- **Integration Ready**: This model can be integrated into various real-world applications like surveillance systems, fire alarms, or industrial monitoring systems.

## Model Weights
The pre-trained model weights are stored in the provided ZIP file. You can load and use these weights for inference and further fine-tuning.

## Setup and Usage

### Clone the Repository
To start using the fire detection model, clone the repository:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/abuzarkhaaan/fire-detection-yolov8.git
